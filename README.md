# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass is a company that is looking to improve the percentage of students who pass their driver's exam. To this end, they requested a system that would allow students to take online courses and schedule on-the-road lessons. They asked that the system include all of the necessary permissions for them to administrate the site.

What did you do particularly well?
  I believe that I did a particularly good job at taking into account all of the different use cases that DriverPass needed to have included in their system. I made sure to include all of the ones that they mentioned in their interview with our company as well as any that i felt were implied by their needs.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would like to revise my work on the functional and non-functional requirements. As I have gotten further into this project, I have built a better understanding of exactly what the system requires and I would like to adapt the lists of requirements to meet that new and improved understanding.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I carefully listened to everyhting that the client had to say about who the user would be and put myself into their shoes to understand what their needs would be. I designed the system in a such a way as to never put them in a situation where they were missing something that they required. It is important to consider the user's needs because the user is the driving force behind the existence of a system.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I approach designing software by breaking it down it the use cases and then tackling how each use case can be accounted for. I will continue to use this technique in the future while being sure to account for the different types of users that interact with the system.
